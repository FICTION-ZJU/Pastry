# Simple loopy program that simulates a random walk. 
# Tight bound is 2 max(0, 1 + n - x)
# Note that x can be n or n+1 when the program 
# terminates. It makes finding and solving 
# recurrence relation harder.

    while x < n:
        prob(1,1):
			# The walker goes forward 
			# 2 step with probability 
            x = x + 2      
        else:
			# 1/2, backward 1 step with 
			# probability 1/2
